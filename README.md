# clj-soap

clj-soap is SOAP server and client using Apache Axis2.

This version is updated from Tetsuya Takatsuru's version to use Clojure 1.5.1 (and modern contrib). Note however that I am not actively maintaining this library and would welcome someone taking it over. I updated Tetsuya's code to use a more modern Clojure environment purely to test it for a problem I was working on - it didn't really do what I needed so I took a different approach (using Axis 1.x libraries at a much lower level for one specific web service).

## Usage

### Client

You can call remote SOAP method as following:
```clojure
(require '[clj-soap.core :as soap])

(let [client (soap/client-fn "http://... (URL for WSDL)")]
  (client :someMethod param1 param2 ...))
```
### Server

To make SOAP service:
```clojure
(require '[clj-soap.core :as soap])

;; Defining service class
(soap/defservice my.some.SoapClass
  (someMethod ^String [^Integer x ^String s]
              (str "x is " x "\ts is " s)))

;; Start SOAP Service
(serve "my.some.SoapClass")
```
`defservice` needs to be AOT-compiled.
For example, `lein compile` before running server.

#### Type Hint

SOAP services need typehints.
`String` for arguments and `void` for return value,
if you don't specify typehints.
